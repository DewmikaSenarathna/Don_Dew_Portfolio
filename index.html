                <p><i> a Computer Engineering student and a creator passionate about building solutions that truly make a difference. 
                    My personal brand, <span>Don Dew</span>, is the foundation of everything I do, and it is powered by my slogan <span>“Ignite Purpose, Elevate Passion, Shape the Future.”</span> 
                    I use my knowledge, skills and ideas to create projects and meaningful innovations that bring real-world impact, stay true to my brand and turn my slogan into action.<br><br>

                    My interests include <span>Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Cloud Computing, Web Development and Aerospace.</span> 
                    I am currently working on research in the biomedical field, applying machine learning to solve practical problems and uncover new possibilities.<br><br>
                    
                    My working style is simple and unique to me. 
                    <span>Understand the problem clearly, create practical solutions and design with both efficiency and elegance.</span> 
                    I have worked on several important projects such as CostBeam, a smart construction management system that improves workflow and decision-making and 
                    the Laboratory Floor-Cleaning Machine, an eco-friendly automation solution that reduces manual effort and improves efficiency. 
                    I have also built full-stack applications like the Lab Rescheduling Management System, 
                    developed MATLAB-based audio classification systems and designed mobile applications. 
                    You can find full details of all my projects in the Projects section.<br><br>

                    Beyond technical abilities, I bring creativity, persistence and a strong solution-oriented mindset to every challenge. 
                    I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with ideas and pushing the limits of what I can create. 
                    Through my brand Don Dew, my goal is not just to develop projects but to build meaningful, impactful solutions that inspire people and improve the world around us.<br><br>

                    I am always open to collaboration, new challenges and opportunities to learn, grow and create something extraordinary. </i>
